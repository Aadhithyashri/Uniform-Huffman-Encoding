### `server.c`, `client.c` and `in.txt` are to be used together, client.c reads from in.txt and sends the encoded message to the server which then decodes it. 
###### `server.c` and `client.c` written using the C socket library for UNIX like operating systems and will NOT work on windows.`huffman.c` however should work on any operating system
